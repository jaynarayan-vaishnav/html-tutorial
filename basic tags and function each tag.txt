 <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in (for e.g what version of html is)  

<html> </html>:- This tag informs the browser that it is an HTML document. Text between html tag describes the web document. 
It is a container for all other elements of HTML except <!DOCTYPE>  

<head> </head>:- The <head> HTML element contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document,
like its title, scripts, and style sheets. 

<meta charset="utf-8"> — This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it.
 There is no reason not to set this and it can help avoid some problems later on.

<body></body> — the <body> element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page,
 whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
     
<img src="source of the img" alt="displays the text when image is broken(text should be about image i.e. action,thing etc)"> - it is a self closing tag.

<!-- 4 heading levels: -->
<h1>My main title</h1>
<h2>My top level heading</h2>
<h3>My subheading</h3>
<h4>My sub-subheading</h4>
Note: You'll see that your heading level 1 has an implicit style. Don't use heading elements to make text bigger or bold, because they are used for accessibility and other reasons such as SEO.
 Try to create a meaningful sequence of headings on your pages, without skipping levels.
